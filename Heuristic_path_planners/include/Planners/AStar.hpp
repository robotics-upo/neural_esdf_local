         * 
         * Some efforts have been made to try to improve this function as it
         * one of the most called methods along with exploreNeighbours. 
         * For exmaple, we tried to avoid the if statement to reduce the number
         * of branches by ussing boolean masks, but it didn't show any
         * significative performance improvement, so for the seek of clarity and 
         * maintenance it's preferable to keep the if structure by the moment.
         * 
         * Example of using masks:
         * 
         *      unsigned int totalCost = _current->G;
         * 
         *      bool maskdd2d = ( using_2d_ && i >= 4 ) || ( !using_2d_ && i > 6 && i < 18);
         *      bool maskdd3d = ( !using_2d_ && i > 18 );
         *
         *      totalCost += dist_scale_factor_;
         *      totalCost += maskdd2d * dd_2D_f + maskdd3d * dd_3D_f;
         * here dd_2D_f = 0.41 (sqrt(2) - 1) and dd_3D_f = 0.3 (sqrt(3) - sqrt(2) )
         * 
         * The current implementation is also more efficient than
         * directly doing 
         * 
         *      unsigned int totalCost = _current->G + heuristic(_current->coordinates, newCoordinates);
         * 
         * 
         * @param _current Pointer to the current node
         * @param _suc Pointer to the successor node
         * @param _n_i The index of the direction in the directions vector. 
         * Depending on this index, the distance wi
         * @param _dirs Number of directions used (to distinguish between 2D and 3D)
         * @return unsigned int The G Value calculated by the function
